## Hello, Sch√∂n guten Tag or Bonjour :-)

This is my Github Repo for my Website (jakubwieloch.com), otherthan that this website will slowly but surely get better.

### BIG Problem :-/

So as might have already noticed, my Website works (mostly) but is kinda fundamentally broken. Let me explain.
**The Problem is**, that if you navigate to a usermade site like my Blog, the Blog itself & the Blog-Posts send you to Localhost:1313 instead of my domain.

If you say I should just use 'hugo' instead of 'hugo server', then you're wrong. Like said, this is a fundamental problem which is likely caused because some template code doesn't later change from localhost:1313 to my domain, even when I just use 'hugo'.

If you even just have an indicator for what the problem could be besides like really obvious shit like setting the baseURL or just running the hugo command, the please open an issue. 

Have a great day :-)
